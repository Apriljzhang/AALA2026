            <h2>Transportation & Accessibility</h2>
            
                <p><p><b>By Air ✈️</b></p>
                <p>Macau International Airport (MFM), located in Taipa, operates 24 hours a day with direct flights from many major Asian cities. For participants travelling from outside Asia, Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) is a convenient hub with excellent onward connections to Macau. From HKG, you can take either a direct bus across the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge or a ferry service to Macau.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>By Sea 🛥️</b></p>
                <p>Macau is well connected by frequent high-speed ferries, offering a comfortable and scenic journey.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal (外港客運碼頭) in the Macau Peninsula operates around the clock.</li>
                    <li>Inner Harbour Ferry Terminal (內港客運碼頭) serves selected routes during daytime hours (07:00–22:00).</li>
                    <li>Taipa Ferry Terminal (氹仔客運碼頭), close to the airport and Cotai area, also operates 24 hours.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ferry from Hong Kong takes approximately 55–60 minutes, with additional links to Shenzhen and Zhuhai.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>By Land 🚗</b></p>
                <p>The Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge has transformed land travel to Macau. A shuttle bus service known as the “Golden Bus” runs 24 hours a day, connecting Hong Kong and Macau in about 40 minutes.</p>
                <p>Macau also shares several land border checkpoints with mainland China:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Border Gate (關閘口岸) – open daily from 06:00 to 01:00, the busiest gateway connecting Zhuhai and Macau.</li>
                    <li>Hengqin Port (橫琴口岸) – a 24-hour crossing directly linking Hengqin and Macau.</li>
                    <li>Qingmao Port (青茂口岸) – a new 24-hour crossing designed for pedestrian travellers.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><b>✅ Tip for participants: </b> For convenience, travellers from Hong Kong International Airport are strongly encouraged to take the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge 
                shuttle bus, which is faster and more cost-effective than the ferry.</p>
